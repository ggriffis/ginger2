          A member of several local, Seattle choirs as well as performing solo and in small ensembles, I am a soprano who focuses on a varied repertoire from Medieval chanting, to Renaissance polyphony, to classical, to early American folk music, and other other genres as well.  My love of singing has taken me on a journey from a complete novice in 2007 to an avid, and continually improving, advanced amateur.  Check out my new trio, The Wayfaring Cats, coming to a church or bar in your neighborhood soon!  I am available as a soloist or as part of my trio to perform at church services, weddings, funerals, or any other event you have in mind.

          I have played the flute since I was 11 years old.  I played for many years with the Seattle Flute Society Flute choir but now focus mainly on small ensemble performances.  I can perform any genre of music but focus mainly on classical and baroque. I am available as a soloist or as part of an ensemble to perform at church services, weddings, funerals, or any other event you have in mind.
